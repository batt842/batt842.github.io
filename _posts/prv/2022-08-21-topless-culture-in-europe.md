23 July 2020
Across all age groups surveyed in the poll of 3,108 people for Ifop's Gender, Sexualities and Sexual Health study, seven percent of French women say they never wear a bra, compared to three percent before lockdown.
32 percent agreeing that their choice was motivated in part by ‚Äúthe desire to fight against the sexualisation of the female breast, which requires hiding them from others‚Äù.
‚ÄúAn exceptional situation has caused women to go from 'what's the point of wearing a bra during lockdown' to 'what's the point of continuing to wear one'.

According to a recent Ifop survey, while just three percent of women said they never or rarely wore a bra before the Covid-19 crisis, this rose to eight percent during the lockdown and stayed at seven percent afterwards.
The trend is even more pronounced among women under 25, 18 percent of whom say they now regularly don‚Äôt wear a bra in public.
However, fear of men‚Äôs reactions also appears to be keeping more women from joining the No Bra movement.
Among the main reasons given for continuing to wear a bra were the fear of verbal or physical harassment in the street and the fear of being stared at by men.
"There is really a generational divide in this practice," said Dubrulle. "Among women who don't practise it, the main obstacle is the fear of being the object of remarks. The fear of being called to order, quite simply. And it's not surprising that it's young women who practice No Bra the most because they're the ones who are most at odds with this manifestation of patriarchy, the culture of rape and all these injunctions that weigh on women's bodies."

For long weeks, women escaped from the external gaze which is trained on their bodies.
This trend provided a new boost for the international #NoBra and #FreetheNipple movements.
Statistics firm Ifop found in a survey of 3,000 women that in 2020 (after the first lockdown) one in six under 25-year-olds in France (18%) said that they never wear a bra. 
This is more than four times higher than before the lockdown, when it was just 4%.
Some 29% of all women surveyed said that they had gone out in the past without wearing a bra. 
Ifop‚Äôs 2020 study also found that 32% of women who do not wear a bra wish to ‚Äúcombat the sexualisation of female breasts, which forces one to hide them from the gaze of others.‚Äù
Some 36% of female respondents to the Ifop study said that they would not want to go out without wearing a bra because they would be worried about attracting ‚Äòlascivious looks‚Äô from men, while 34% feared being the subject of sexual harasssment or assault.

Mon 28 Jul 2014
According to French Elle, women have stopped sunbathing topless in France.
First, an increased concern over health and the dangers of skin cancer; second, the "pornified" perception of topless women; and third, the rise of breast-affiliated activism.
"Topless sunbathing was seen by women as a new freedom in St Tropez in the 1960s," says Elle. And now that they're covering up? It's a "worrying sign of a regression in the place of women".
Ever since Brigitte Bardot took off her top on the French Riviera in the 1960s, the correlation between topless sunbathing and women's liberation has been entrenched in French culture as a sign of true equality.
News that so few women are now going topless (just 2% of women under 35 said they did) seems extraordinary ‚Äì and depressing.
Alice Pfeiffer, a 29-year-old Anglo-French journalist (who, incidentally does sunbathe topless in Biarritz, Gu√©thary, Monaco and surfing resort Hossegor), thinks the decline is inextricably linked to social media: "Young women in their 20s do it less because they are aware that ... you can end up topless on your own Facebook wall."
Pfeiffer blames "pop-porn culture ‚Äì Miley Cyrus to American Apparel, ie aggressive naked imagery of young girls" ‚Äì for the shift in perception of going topless.
"Globalisation and Americanisation of women's portrayal and sexiness in France has pushed away gentle (and generally harmless) French eroticism towards porno, frontal, hyper-sexualised consciousness," she says. "Nudist, beach-like freedom is not what it used to be ... breasts no longer feel innocent or temporarily asexual."
Though probably universal, this attitude towards topless sunbathing has had the biggest impact in France. It is still the norm in Germany, according to one recent survey, which suggests almost a third of Germans and Austrians sunbathe naked. A straw poll in the UK also suggests it's equally de rigueur: one in six women we asked said they have or would sunbathe topless: "I don't think about skin cancer or being photographed or activism when I go topless," says Jess, 32 of north-west London. "I just want an all-over tan."
"I've never seen young women doing it loads. But some women over 50 do."
"Family albums here can be a strange thing, as you flip through three generations of bourgeois bra-less women." But she maintains that "French women of most ages have, as far as I can remember, sunbathed topless."
Costa-Kostritsky thinks the decline could be linked to health concerns, but these are less about skin damage and more about vanity: "Women of my generation have always been told that the sun was bad for our skin. But add sun damage to gravity and the fear is you won't have pretty breasts."

Men can also go shirtless in public (the law banning it was abolished in 1994) but many local authorities frown on it and some give out local fines for doing so.
There is no rule banning women being topless on French beaches but it is not allowed on city beaches such as those along the river Seine in Paris.
There is no national law banning someone being totally naked anywhere in France, but there is a law against disturbing public order.
Men can also go shirtless in public (the law banning it was abolished in 1994) but many local authorities frown on it and some give out local fines for doing so.
What started in the 1960s and particularly the riots of 1968 turned into a revolution and although initially denounced as ‚Äúun Christian‚Äù, by 1975, half of all women were topless on French beaches‚Äìhelped in no small part by Brigitte Bardot going topless in Saint Tropez. As reported by The Local, by the mid 1970s, 75% of the French public approved. It was a way to prove that a woman was liberated and free from patriarchal pressures.
By 1984, just 43% of women were sunbathing topless and by 2016, it was 29%. For women under 35, however, this figure drops as low as 2%.
For many, it‚Äôs because of increased fears over skin cancer and over-exposure to the sun. For others, it‚Äôs because times have once more changed and due to increased ‚Äúpornification‚Äù of women, many are becoming more modest, declaring that they feel ‚Äúloose‚Äù when they sunbathe topless. They are also worried about being filmed, attacked, or their body being critiqued.
Also, women have increasingly campaigned topless in political protests and some women don‚Äôt want to be seen as campaigners for something they don‚Äôt believe in.

the very French tradition of topless sunbathing has been defended as a vital freedom by a government official after a local police force tried to get a group of women to cover up.
France's interior minister intervened in the debate over bikini removal in response to the outrage that followed an incident on the beach at Sainte-Marie-la-Mer, in southern France.

Sunbathing topless exists in something of a legal gray area in France, and there is no national legislation legalizing it.
Local authorities are free to set their own rules, and some allow topless or naked sunbathing in certain areas.
However, sexual exhibition imposed on another person in a public space is punishable by a ‚Ç¨15,000 (about $17,700) fine and one year in prison.

In 2019, parliament said that its stance on women going topless "follows the evolution of customs and of the notion of decency," underlining that "the female breast is considered an intimate part of the body, falling under the sexual organs." ü§Ø

Only 19 percent of French women under the age of 50 say they regularly sunbathe topless in France compared to 29 percent three years ago and 43 percent of women back in 1984.
‚ÄúFor people under 25, it is the fear of leering eyes and for 51 percent of them it's the fear of being the object of an attack (verbal, physical or sexual). We can talk about a MeToo effect at the beach,‚Äù he said.
Another reason women are keeping the top halves of their bikinis on, according to the study, was to avoid negative comments or looks about their physique.
‚ÄúFor the women of the 60s and 70s going to the beach topless was a way to show that they were liberated from patriarchy, sexual restraint,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúBut for the current generation, women consider themselves sufficiently liberated to no longer have to prove it. (ü§î Really? Under the circumstance where women fear men's sexual assault?)
The fear among younger women of being snapped topless by someone with a smartphone and having the pictured shared among their social circles may also put many off, Mossuz-Lavau said.
‚ÄúThe main point this survey reveals is that contrary to what one might believe, French women are more ‚Äúmodest‚Äù than their neighbors,‚Äù
While 22 percent of French women say they have sunbathed topless, the figure was far higher in Germany where 34 percent of women had gone topless and far behind Spain where 48 percent of women say they had removed the top half of the bikini on beaches.
In Italy the number of women who had gone topless was 15 percent, less than in Britain where 19 percent of women had opted for the ‚Äúmonokini‚Äù at some point.
But the decline in the number of women going topless is reflected throughout Europe ‚Äì apart from Spain where the trend remains consistently strong.
Within France itself it's no surprise perhaps to find out that women in the south, particularly region of Provence-Alpes C√¥te d'Azur are far more likely (36 percent) to go topless than those in the north (just 7 percent in the Hauts-de-France).

Just 19% of breasted sunbathers in the country now say they feel comfortable removing their tops at the beach. Compare that with 2009, when 34% said they do, or in 1984 with 40%.
French pollster Ifop conducted the survey in conjunction with ‚ÄúWorld Topless Day‚Äù on Thursday, which includes responses from over 5,000 Europeans, including 1,000 French women.
For 48% of French ladies, physical safety was the primary concern; 46% also said they feared photos of their bare chests might end up on social media.
Women are also exhibiting a healthy fear of skin cancer as 53% said they opt to cover up to avoid unnecessary sun damage.
