I've got touching feedback collected for the mid-year check-in from my colleagues. Many of them gladly left kind words that proved I worked well to give technical answers and engineering support to other engineers. I sincerely appreciate their valuable thoughts.

It also gives me some homework. The feedback was mostly about my supportive behaviors, good collaboration, and well-led projects. Although it meets the senior software engineer's duties, it doesn't satisfy all.

One of the senior's requirements that I want to focus on is to introduce an initiative proactively. Although I've tried, it wasn't recognized enough. So, I should work on finding underlying issues and suggesting solutions while keeping my workload manageable.

What do I do? I still tend to find an answer on my own, which is fun for an engineer. Furthermore, I sometimes spend too much time wandering around an exciting problem. It's probably time to shift slightly from answering to searching for a question.

Delegation is a crucial key when it comes to balancing them with a manageable workload, at least for me for now. It also allows colleagues to grow with a wide range of topics. I've been trying to distribute tasks and topics on the team's plate for a while, but I should do better with this. Well, keeping it in mind, let's see how my daily working pattern and my position in the team will change.
