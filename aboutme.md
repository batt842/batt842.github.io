Oh, Junseok

I'm a **Software Engineer** developing **Backend Applications** mainly using **Java** and **Kotlin**.

Currently, I'm working at **[Delivery Hero SE][DHSE]** located in Berlin, Germany.

I'm interested in **Large-Scale Distributed System**, **Microservices Architecture**, and **Functional Programming**.

My major programming languages are **Java**, **Kotlin**.

I've been finding questions about the world because I believe a good problem and a very new solution could lead the world to a yet unexplored path.

Besides, I'm a drawing enthusiast, knowledge lover, and, of course, engineer. Recently, I'm considering a way to weave art and knowledge neatly into my profession.
