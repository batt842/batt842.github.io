Oh, Junseok

I'm a **Software Engineer** developing **Server-Side Applications** mainly using **Java**.

Currently, I'm working for **[DAUM Search][DAUM]** at **[Kakao Corp.][Kakao Corp.]** located in **Jeju, South Korea**.

I'm interested in **Large-Scale Distributed System**, **Microservices Architecture**, and **Functional Programming.**

My main technical skills are **Java**, **HBase**, **Redis**, **Spark**, and **Web Crawling**. Also, I've worked with **Spring**, **Javascript**, **DRM**, and so on. 

I've been finding questions about the world because I believe a good problem and a very new solution could lead the world to a yet unexplored path.

Besides, I'm a drawing enthusiast, knowledge lover, and, of course, engineer. Recently, I'm considering a way to weave art and knowledge neatly into my profession.
