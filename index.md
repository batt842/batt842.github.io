Hi, Iâ€™m Junseok Oh. You can just call me Jun.

This is a personal blog where I'm trying to post my thoughts about my interests.

Currently, I'm working as a backend software engineer at **[Delivery Hero SE][DHSE]** located in Berlin, Germany.

I'm interested in **Large-Scale Distributed System**, **Microservices Architecture**, and **Functional Programming**.

My major programming languages are **Java**, **Kotlin**.

I've been searching for questions about the world because I believe a good question and an innovative answer could lead the world to a yet unexplored, hopefully better, way.

Besides, I'm a drawing enthusiast, knowledge lover, and, of course, engineer. Recently, I'm considering a way to weave art and knowledge neatly into my profession.
