Hi, I'm Junseok Oh, but feel free to call me Jun.

This is my personal blog where I share thoughts on topics that interest me.

I currently work as a backend software engineer at **[Delivery Hero SE][DHSE]**, based in Berlin, Germany.

In terms of my career, I'm passionate about **Large-Scale Distributed Systems**, **Microservices Architecture**, and **Indie Game Development**.

My current tech stack includes **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, **Kubernetes**, **Microservices**, **Hexagonal Architecture**, and **AWS**. I specialize in **Fintech**, specifically **Online Payments System**.

I also have experience in **Windows application programming**, **Hadoop**, **HBase**, **Web search**, and other technologies, though they are a bit outdated now.

I've been searching for questions about the world and myself because I believe a good question and an innovative answer could lead to a yet unexplored, hopefully better, way.

Outside of work, I'm a drawing enthusiast, knowledge lover, and, of course, engineer. Recently, I'm contemplating how to integrate art and knowledge into my profession.
