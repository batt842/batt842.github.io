Hi Chayan,
thank you for following me in weeks. I want to rephrase some ideas I shared during the previous sprint.

I believe you've got an idea about how code review works through the recent coding tasks. It's not just a final confirmation step of a code change. It's a process of exchanging opinions on logic, code, coding style, feature, etc.

It helps anyone, not just junior, develop their code gradually through multiple iterations, like starting from a rough sketch for a painting. (If you want to know a different sketch style of coding, it'd be nice to check TDD.) It's a universal approach to start small, fail early, and frequently measure if you don't have crystal-clear foresight. It would be best to open your change early to your colleagues and ask for a review at an appropriate interval.

As long as you ask for a review in an appropriate interval, code review would give a reviewer a holistic view and make us work asynchronously, which is more time-efficient. The review interval may vary depending on the task's difficulty or characteristic and the coder's level.

So, you'd better communicate with colleagues via PR to be more effective and productive, especially when it comes to coding or code design. PR was made for an efficient code review and effective commit merging. Again, Git and Github are collaborative tools, and code review is a communication process rather than a confirmation step. It would help if you utilized the tools appropriately.

Of course, there are so many cases you need to ask others or open a question in a Slack channel. It's recommended to ask after you've tried enough to find an answer by yourself although it's a bit hard to find just 'enough' amount of effort not hurting efficiency too much. By the way, Google may answer you in many ways because many people have already had the same questions we have.

I want to emphasize we do not usually provide coding instructions with hints to our colleagues. I thought it was necessary for your coding practice because I expect you to be better in coding skills than what you've shown me during the previous coding tasks.

To expend your coding skills further, I recommend you to check the following topics.
1. OOP SOLID principles
2. OOP design patterns (essential): Observer, decoration, factory, singleton, adaptor, and facade patterns
There are many online courses, materials, and articles available for free, which you can utilize. Please carefully choose materials that provide enough explanation and examples. You'd better implement the examples yourself since it's more effective to understand.

I'm having a two-week vacation since Apr 4th. In the meantime, our colleagues will help you work on your tasks. Please keep learning, practicing, recording, and measuring. I believe you will grow more in coding skills and product understanding in the coming months. Thank you.

Regards,
Jun Oh


He needs to build a good development plan, including measurable goals, ETA, and current progress. As far as I know, senior engineers have been helping with the development plan. It might also be necessary to measure the progress periodically, such as weekly, so he can motivate himself.
Although learning by working is an excellent method, it requires active learner retrospection. For example, suppose a learner solves a challenging issue. In that case, they should leave a record, find more articles related to the issue, and set a further plan to improve knowledge and skills related to the issue and solution. Otherwise, 80% of learning will just be gone.
